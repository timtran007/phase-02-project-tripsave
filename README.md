# TripSave MVP

TripSave is a React application utilizing a json-server to run a RESTful API of destinations you want budget and save for while being able to add more destinations. In addition, TripSave is using React Router for client-side routing and performs a PATCH fetch request to update savings amount.

## TripSave Project Description

Do you have a bucket list destination, but have a hard time saving money for it? Next time you grab a coffee, stop what you are doing and quickly add that money to your dream destination. 

TripSave is an app that allows users to add their dream destination, create a budget, and add money towards that special trip youâ€™ve been dying to go on.

## Usage
Client-Side Routing for a NavBar using NavLink
```
        <nav >
                <NavLink exact className="nav" activeClassName="active" to="/">
                    Home
                </NavLink>
                <NavLink className="nav" to="/destination">
                    Trips
                </NavLink> 
                <NavLink className="nav" to="add-a-trip">
                    Add a Trip
                </NavLink>
        </nav>
```

Handle Submitting Controlled Form
```
    function handleSubmit(event){
        event.preventDefault()
        console.log(formData)
        fetch('http://localhost:3500/destination',{
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(formData),
        })
        setFormData({
            destinationName: "",
            imgURL: "",
            budget: 0,
            savings: 0,
        })
    }
```
